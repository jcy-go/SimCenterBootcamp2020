C++: Day 3 In Class Exercises
===========================

Today we have two problems for you to tackle.

Problem 1: Adding a ColoredShape
--------------------------------

Navigate to **/code/c++/ExerciseDay3/ex1/** to find the code for the C__ example presented in todays video. You are asked to create another shape of your choosing and add to the code base. A similar example was perfomed during the video.


.. note::

   A CmakeLists.txt file has been provided. Add your file to it when created. The build process again is:

   .. code::

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make

The **cmake** command will check your system for compilers and other development tool and create a **Makefile** in each source folder. The **make** will build the executable(s)

.. note:: 

    Placing the compile files into a *build* folder makes cleanup easier: simply delete
    the entire *build* folder when done.  It can be regenerated easily using the above procedure.

   
Problem 2: An engineering Vector Class requires you to finish off
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to **/code/c++/ExerciseDay3/ex2/** to find the partially completed code for a C++ Vector class. You are to finish it and test it.
